  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Giorgi Giorgadze, a 16-year-old student passionate about technology and programming. For the past two years, I’ve been learning and building websites, constantly expanding my knowledge and skills in the world of development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over this time, I have worked on many practical assignments and gained hands-on experience with the following technologies:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>HTML, CSS</strong> – Solid foundation in creating the structure and styling of modern websites.</li>
    <li><strong>TypeScript & Angular</strong> – I actively work on Angular-based frontend projects, building dynamic and modular web applications.</li>
    <li><strong>C# and ASP.NET API</strong> – I have experience developing RESTful APIs and working with backend technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Development (3D)</strong> – I’m also learning 3D game development and creating small personal projects to sharpen my creativity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Throughout my learning journey, I’ve completed various projects that have helped me improve both my technical and problem-solving skills. Technology isn’t just a career path for me — it’s a true passion, a daily motivation, and the direction I want to grow in.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the future, I plan to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development and game design, and aim to create digital products that bring real value to users.
